Fellow Dwarves!

Stop relying on your flawed memory and scattered Discord pins. I got tired of looking up the same stats, so I had an AI help me parse, compile, and structure the chaotic raw data from the official Wiki, Discord theorycrafting, pure in-game testing, and community feedback into one interactive web app. Because doing manual data entry in 2026 is for masochists.

It won't play the game for you, and it won't fix your bad positioning. It just stops you from making mathematically stupid decisions at the forge and during boss fights.

What this database actually contains:

* Item Database & Set Explorer: A searchable table of every weapon, armor, and shield. Simulate swapping set pieces to see exact stat changes and active ultimates before you ruin a build.

* Bosses & Champions: The exact mechanics, threat levels, and accepted counters for all Trolls, Spiders, Wyverns, and the Forge Demon. Includes drop rules for Champion Dwarves and Orcs.

* Rune Circle & Ultimates: All 77 runes (Bronze to Gold) and all 49 weapon ultimates mapped out with their correct scaling and tags.

* Formations & Classes: Requirements and effects for all 22 clan, element, and battlerune formations, plus scaling data for all 13 classes.

* Artifacts & Veterans: A database of 45 artifacts by biome and a tier list for all 16 Veteran passives.

* Forge Mechanics: Searchable lists for anvil recipes, biome-specific mythic modifiers, and stat roll ranges.

(It’s a pure web app, runs in your browser, no downloads required. If you find data errors, drop your feedback in the comments so I can correct the logic.)

May your axes be sharp and your beers be cold. 🍺⚔️
